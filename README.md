## FAQ

Q: How long does a typical project take?
A: Discovery sprints are 1–4 weeks; MVPs are commonly 6–12 weeks depending on scope. We provide a detailed timeline during scoping.

Q: How do you handle intellectual property?
A: We typically agree on IP terms upfront. By default, client work transfers IP to the client once final payment is complete. We can negotiate alternative terms for libraries or shared components.

Q: What about data ownership and model training?
A: Clients retain ownership of their data. For model training that uses client data, we agree on usage, retention, and deletion policies in the contract.

Q: Do you provide SLAs for production systems?
A: Yes — for managed services we provide SLA-based support with agreed response times.
